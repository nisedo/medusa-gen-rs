 # Ideas

- Skip parsing interfaces.
- Consider merging abstract base functions into child handlers via inheritance resolution.
- Prefer `src/` as the source root when present (Foundry layout).
- Offer an optional AST/ABI parse path via `forge build` or `solang` for correctness.
- Auto-bound numeric inputs in handlers (e.g., `bound` for uints) to reduce trivial overflows.
- Add `vm.assume` placeholders in handlers for common safety checks.
- Emit a payable funding stub when payable functions exist (e.g., `vm.deal` comment).
- Prepopulate `Setup.t.sol` with `setTarget...` wiring stubs for each handler.
- Include handler function name, mutability/payable flags, and selector in `PROPERTIES.md`.
- Patch `compilation.platformConfig.target` even if it already exists but differs.
- If `targetContracts` is non-empty and missing `FuzzTest`, append it.
- Print a concise generation summary (contracts, handlers, properties, output path).
- Add a “generated by medusa-gen” header comment to emitted files.
- Skip test contracts (e.g., `*.t.sol`) even if they live under `src/`.
- Skip libraries by default (ABI may include them) to reduce noise.
- Warn on duplicate contract names across different source files.
- Log when `forge build`/ABI parsing fails and that we’re falling back to source parsing.
- Auto-detect a default `solc` version from `forge config` or pragma if `--solc` isn’t provided.
